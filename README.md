🧠 Twitter Bot Detection using Neural Networks  This project focuses on detecting automated (bot) accounts on Twitter using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify Twitter accounts as bots or humans based on various user, tweet, and network features.

🚀 Overview

With the rise of social media automation, bots can manipulate online discourse, spread misinformation, and artificially boost engagement. This project uses a neural network model to analyze user metadata and tweet behavior to accurately detect such accounts.

🧩 Features

Data preprocessing and feature extraction from Twitter datasets (e.g., Twibot, Botometer, or custom collected data).

Neural network architecture built with TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Comparison with traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Visualization of model performance with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC.

🧰 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook for analysis

🧪 Workflow

Data Collection – Obtain labeled Twitter account data.

Feature Engineering – Extract numerical features (followers count, tweet frequency, sentiment, etc.).

Model Training – Train a neural network classifier on preprocessed data.

Evaluation – Assess model performance on a validation/test set.

Deployment (optional) – Export the trained model for integration with real-time detection systems.
